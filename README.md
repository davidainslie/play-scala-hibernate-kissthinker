Demo/Tutorial of Scala/Play/Hibernate Application
=================================================

Front to back demo/tutorial application of taking a BDD approach to Scala stack technologies with Hibernate on the backend
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Application built with the following technologies:

- Scala 2.11.1

- SBT 0.13.5

- Play 2.2.0

and including

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript/CoffeeScript, JQuery, Ajax, Twitter Bootstrap

Introduction
------------

This project is a follow on from the use of <a href="https://github.com/davidainslie/play-scala-mybatis-kissthinker">Play/Scala/MyBatis</a>, which has a full description of coding with BDD.
All explanations leading up to MyBatis are relevant here.
To help you on this application, please read up to discussion of the use of MyBatis and then switch back here where Hibernate is used instead.
Note there are also Mongodb versions.

Please note, that even though we are using Hibernate, the code/interface will be standard JPA, where Hibernate is one of the top implementations.

Setup
-----

Upon cloning this project (or downloading and decompressing the zip) you can run the application (before viewing the code) if you have Play installed.
Don't have Play (or just need more information) then goto:
http://www.playframework.com
and
http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.2.0/Installing (where as of writing, the current version of Play is 2.2.0)

Specs
-----
First take a look at the specs.
They can be run individually in your IDE or from SBT command line console using the "test" command.
There are both unit and integration specs.

Another project I've started but not actually started yet! Dear me!
