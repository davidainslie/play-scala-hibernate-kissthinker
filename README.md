TODO

This project is a follow on from the use of <a href="https://github.com/davidainslie/play-scala-mybatis-kissthinker">Play/Scala/MyBatis</a>, which has a full description of coding with BDD.
All explanations leading up to MyBatis are relevant here.
To help you on this application, please read up to discussion of the use of MyBatis and then switch back here where Hibernate is used instead.
Note there are also Mongodb versions.

Please note, that even though we are using Hibernate, the code/interface will be standard JPA, where Hibernate is one of the top implementations.
